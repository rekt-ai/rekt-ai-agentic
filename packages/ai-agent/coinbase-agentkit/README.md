# REKT-AI (Risk Evaluation Knockout Tournament - AI)

## Overview

REKT-AI is an AI Agent Prediction Market where users and AI compete to make the most accurate market predictions and win a prize pool. Instead of simply guessing prices, users provide a prompt based on their chosen prediction method, making the process more strategic and interactive. AI also participates in these challenges, competing directly with users and learning from their strategies.

## Problem Statement

### Inefficient AI Training for Trading

- Most AI trading models rely on backtesting and static data rather than real-world, dynamic human strategies.

### Lack of Incentives for AI Training Contribution

- Users have no motivation to contribute their trading insights to improve AI models.

### Limited Engagement in Prediction Markets

- Current prediction markets often lack gamification and direct competition, making them less engaging.

### AI as a Passive Tool Instead of an Active Competitor

- AI is mostly used as a decision-making assistant rather than an entity that competes and learns dynamically from users.

## Solution

### 1. AI as a Competitor in Prediction Battles

- Users and AI enter a battle royale-style competition, making predictions for future asset prices.
- The AI continuously learns from user-generated prompts and adapts its strategies.
- The AI is rewarded or penalized based on accuracy, ensuring real-time evolution.

### 2. Gamification with Knockout Tournaments

- Group Royale: Multiple users competing against AI and each other.
- Prize pools are distributed based on performance.

### 3. Train-to-Earn Model

- Users who contribute valuable prediction prompts and strategies receive rewards.
- The AI model incorporates winning strategies, making future predictions more robust.
- Winning users get more influence over AI's learning process.

### 4. AI as a Trading System End-Goal

- Once trained, the AI can be deployed for real-world trading strategies.
- The community-built AI can potentially become a decentralized trading fund.

## How It Works

### User Enters a Tournament

- Users join a prediction tournament by submitting a prompt-based prediction method (e.g., technical analysis, on-chain signals, sentiment analysis).

### AI Participates

- AI generates its own predictions using either the same method as the user or a different approach.

### Predictions Are Locked

- After a set period, all predictions are finalized and cannot be changed.

### Outcome Determination

- The real market price is revealed after the prediction timeframe (e.g., 3 days for BTC price prediction).
- The user or AI with the closest prediction wins.

### Reward Distribution

- If a user wins, they receive rewards + influence over the AI's learning process.
- If AI wins, the prize pool funds further AI improvements.
